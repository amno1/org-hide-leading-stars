* About

  A small hack to reduce clutter in my init file, but can be potentially used
  elsewhere too. It will completely hide leading star markers by changing their
  'invisible' text property.

  There is probably a limited utility for this hack. The important thing to note
  is that is removes the indentation, since indentation is by definition
  introduced with leading stars. That may or may not be a dealbreaker for some
  use-cases.

  Eventually, one could add an extra space after the leading stars, one per each
  leading star, to keep a minimal amount of indentation going on, even if stars
  are hidden.

* Installation  

  Either clone this repo or just download 'org-hide-leading-stars.el'.

  Put org-hide-leading-stars.el somewhere in Emacs load-path. From there you
  have option to either:

  M-x package-install-file RET org-hide-leading-stars.el RET

  or just require file in your init file somewhere.

* Requirements

  Really none, should be compatible with Emacs 22.1 but package.el does not
  recognize requirements older than Emacs 24.1, it is satt to that one.

* Usage

  M-x org-hide-heading-stars-mode to turn it on/off.
  
* Issues

  Let me know.
