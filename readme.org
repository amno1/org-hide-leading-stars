* About

  A small hack to reduce clutter in my init file, but can be potentially used
  elsewhere too. It will completely hide leading star markers by changing their
  'invisible' text property.

* Installation  

  Either clone this repo or just download 'org-hide-leading-stars.el'.

  Put org-hide-leading-stars.el somewhere in Emacs load-path. From there you
  have option to either:

  M-x package-install-file RET org-hide-leading-stars.el RET

  or just require file in your init file somewhere.

* Usage

  M-x org-hide-heading-stars-mode to turn it on/off.
  
* Issues

  Let me know.
  
* Screenshots
