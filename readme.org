* About

  A small hack to reduce clutter in my init file, but can be potentially used
  elsewhere too. It will completely hide leading star markers by changing their
  'invisible' text property.

* Installation  

  Either clone this repo or just download 'ob-hide-markers.el'. From there you
  have option to either M-x package-install-file RET org-hide-leading-stars.el
  RET or just put the file somewhere where Emacs can find it and do appropriate
  autoload or require.

* Usage

  M-x org-hide-heading-stars-mode to turn it on/off.
  
* Issues

  Let me know.
  
* Screenshots

* License

  GPL v3. For details, see the atached [[./LICENSE][license file]].
